# Building
* this is only tested on linux
* you need to have SDL2 installed in your system

```bash
    make
```
and you will find the executable in bin directory

## Running:
- you need to provide the ROM files and combine them into one file, by order: .h, .g, .f, .e

## TODO

* Implement AC flag
* Add sound support
* Add color support
